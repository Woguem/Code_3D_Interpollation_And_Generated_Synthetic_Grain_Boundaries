Atomic Structure Interpolation and Synthetic Grain Boundary Generation

Overview

This repository contains two main components:

Atomic Structure Interpolation code: A script that interpolates the Nye tensor of atomic structure of a grain boundary (GB) based on input atomic coordinates and Nye tensor.

Synthetic Grain Boundary Generation code: A script that generates synthetic GB structures using the interpolated data from the first step.

Additionally, the repository includes a data file used for the second script to generate realistic synthetic GBs.

Features

Accurate atomic structure interpolation on the grid using mathematical techniques to have continuum image.

Synthetic grain boundary generation based on interpolation results.

The images generated are used for the deep learning task.
